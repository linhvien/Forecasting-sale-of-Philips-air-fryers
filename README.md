# Forecasting-sale-of-Philips-air-fryers
I apply time-series analysis and machine learning model to forecast the sale of Philips air fryers. The forecasting models applied are shown below:
- Holt-Winter
- ARIMA model
- SARIMA model

- Hybrid SARIMA and SVR

I focus on the sale of Europe market given Europe has sold the greatest number of air fryer, accounting for 35.5% of total global volume of Philips air fryers.
